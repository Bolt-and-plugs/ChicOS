# ChicOS 

This is a University Operetional Systems class project, meanwhile a playground for us to taste the feeling of being a kernel programmer (roughly). For now, we do not have the instructions for what to follow, so, until then, this project will only handle some utilities and default operations we think a OS must implement. Later on, this will become (as we believe) a (not) fully functional OS.

To test the project for yourself, simply run:

```sh

cmake -S . -B target/

cmake --build target/

./target/ChicOS

```
